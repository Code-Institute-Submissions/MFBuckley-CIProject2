# Interactive Frontend Project - Milestone Project 2 - Code Institute, Dublin, Ireland

A computerised version of a game of Simon - an interactive audio/visual game. A series of tones and lights are generated randomly by the computer. A player is rerquired to repeat the sequence correctly. 
If the player succeeds, each round becomes progressively longer and more complex.
Depending on which mode is played, if the user fails the game is over and the player must start all over again(strict mode) or 
further attempts at the level are possible until successful (non-strict mode).

## Game Instructions

Your task is to repeat the sequence of tones and lights played/shown by the computer 
by clicking on the respective quadrants immediately after the computer has finished.

1. Select checkbox "Power" to load game.

1. Click "Start" button.

1. The computer will play a sequence of tones complementary to a sequece of flashing quadrants in the circle.

1. When the computer has finished, repeat the sequence by clicking on the red, yellow, blue and green quadrants 
in the correct order to make it to the next level.

1. Complete all 10 rounds to win the game.

Strict mode causes the game to reset to the very start if an error is made by the player.

## Existing Features

Click buttons/quadrants allow users to start and play the game. Check boxes "power" the game on or 
make the game a little more difficult by resetting to the start every time an error is made.

### Features left to implement
Quadrant borders light up on hover.
Replace checkboxes with slide buttons.
Increase the number of rounds that can be played overall.
